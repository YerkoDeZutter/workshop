# Linking Canvas

After you linked your JS file to your HTML file you can start Linking your Canvas element so you can control it in JS.

make a var from the canvas element by using a querySelector.<br>
this var you can then change: give the width and height to the canvas and declaring the context. <br>
The context of a canvas element tells it's type. most used context type for canvas is "2d". the 2d type makes simple 2d animations, drawings, interactable images and games.

## make it visubel

After we make a var out the canvas and give it o context we are actually done. But the problem is that we don't see anything. so lets Make a background.

by making a background in our canvas we just make simple rectangle whit the width and height of the Canvas. and give that same rectangle a color. witch is placed right above where you create the rectangle itself.
