# place circle somewhere random on screen

The random placement is a but different from a random size. Whit a Random placement you need to make 2 var's (1 for x aces and 1 for y aces). And the maximum is not optional (al long as you want it to show up anywhere on the window). So you have to set the max to the canvas width for width. And height for height.
